This program separates each app sector with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I wanted to create a fast math game that challenges users to solve prompts in a timed environment. 
As the user solves the prompts, they become more difficult, and the user only has 30 seconds to solve as many prompts as possible.
Currently, it only supports addition, but I plan to add subtraction, multiplication, and division later. 
Iâ€™m currently making the web page responsive, and then I will be converting the game into a single page application using React.
