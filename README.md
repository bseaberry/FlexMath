This program separates each app sector with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I wanted to create a fast math game that challenges users to solve prompts in a timed environment. 
As the user solves the prompts, they become more difficult, and the user only has 30 seconds to solve as many prompts as possible.
Currently, it only supports addition, but I plan to add subtraction, multiplication, and division later. 
Iâ€™m currently converting the game to a single-page application using React.
